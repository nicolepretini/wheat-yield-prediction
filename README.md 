# Wheat Yield Prediction (FAOSTAT)

This project uses historical FAOSTAT crop statistics to predict wheat yield (ton/ha) from year and region.

It is a minimal end-to-end machine learning pipeline in Python:
- Data loading and filtering (wheat only)
- Train/test split
- Preprocessing (year as numeric, region one-hot encoded)
- Two models: Linear Regression and Random Forest
- Evaluation using RMSE and R²

## Data

The dataset includes:
- `Year`
- `Region`
- `Crop`
- `Yield_ton_ha`

Filtered subset:
- Only rows where `Crop` contains "Wheat".

## Methods

1. Filter FAOSTAT data to wheat only.
2. Remove rows with missing yield, year or region.
3. Define features:
   - `Year` (numeric)
   - `Region` (categorical, one-hot encoded)
4. Train two models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
5. Evaluate on a hold-out test set (20%) using:
   - RMSE (root mean squared error)
   - R² (coefficient of determination)

## Results

On the wheat subset (504 rows):

| Model             | RMSE (ton/ha) | R²   |
|-------------------|--------------:|:----:|
| Linear Regression | 0.46          | 0.91 |
| Random Forest     | 0.30          | 0.96 |

The Random Forest model substantially improves prediction accuracy and explains ~96% of the variation in wheat yield in this dataset.

## Tech stack

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Interpretation of Results

Note: FAOSTAT reports yields in kg/ha.
Thus:
- RMSE ≈ 458 → 0.458 t/ha
- RMSE ≈ 303 → 0.303 t/ha

These match expected wheat global yield prediction accuracy and align with typical regional yield variability.
